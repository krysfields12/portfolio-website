What is node? 
- Open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers create all kinds of server-side tools and applications
    in Javacript.
- The runtime is intended for use OUTSIDE of the browser context
    ** allows for you to write a J program that runs directly on a computer, NOT through
         a web browser on a computer, but directly on a computer and can access anything on that machine as long it has permissions
- You can use Node.js to create a simple web server using Node HTTP package.  

Building a server with Node
- Programs we write that intend to receive and respond to HTTP messsages are called servers
- Node.js provides several low-level tools for building servers
- Abtracts HTTP request and responses into nice objects that have useful methods.

HTTP
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is the foundation of any data exchange on the web
- A protocol for transmitting resources (e.g. HTML, plain text, images, JSON) 
    ** Specifically, a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually
        the web browser.
